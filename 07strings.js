const name = "srujan"
const age = 20
console.log(name + age)

console.log(' Hello my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old') // do not use normal ticks always ude backticks
console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`); // correct way
// also using placeholders is best way rather than just adding strings.






/*
Summary
strings can be denoted with 'single' or "double quotes"  and do not require any special characters. 
Strings are used to store text data in programming languages.
String Interpolation: String interpolation in JavaScript is a way to embed or insert variables into a string. 
Instead of using concatenation with the + operator, you can use template literals, enclosed by backticks ( ), 
to include variables directly within a string.
 the ${} syntax allows you to embed variables (name and age) directly within the string.
  The result is a more concise and readable way to create strings with dynamic content.
